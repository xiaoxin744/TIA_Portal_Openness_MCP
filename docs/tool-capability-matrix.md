## L0

### Bootstrap

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| Bootstrap | [L0][Bootstrap] FIRST tool any AI model should call. Read-only single-call orientation: returns TIA version, Openness group status, current connection/project state, the recommended next tool, the L0/L1 tool roster, and known TIA Openness limitations. Does NOT connect to TIA Portal — call Connect afterwards based on RecommendedNextTool. |

### Diagnostics

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| RunCapabilitySelfTest | [L0][Diagnostics]Run a read-only MCP/TIA readiness self-test. It checks Openness group membership, connection state, visible portal processes, optional automation context, and optional project tree readback without writing to the project. |
| RunOnlineMonitoringSafetySelfTest | [L0][Diagnostics]Run a static, read-only safety self-test for online monitoring guardrails. It does not connect to TIA Portal, open projects, modify watch tables, write PLC values, or expose forced-value operations. |

### Portal

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GetState | [L0][Portal] Get current connection state: IsConnected, open Project name, and open Session name. Use this to check preconditions before other tools — if IsConnected=false, call Connect first; if Project is empty, call OpenProject or CreateProject. |

### Reports

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GenerateAcceptanceReport | [L0][Reports]Generate a read-only acceptance report for the current MCP/TIA environment. The default mode does not attach to TIA or write to the project; it writes Markdown/JSON report files to outputDirectory. |
| GenerateErrorReport | [L0][Reports]Generate a standardized Markdown/JSON error report. This is file/report generation only; it does not touch TIA Portal or modify projects. |

## L1

### Diagnostics

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| ValidateAutomationContext | [L1][Diagnostics]Preflight current project for automation: devices, software, expected PLC/HMI paths, and project tree. |

### Hardware

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| ConnectDeviceNodesToProfinetSubnet | [L1][Hardware] PREFERRED for PROFINET network setup. Finds the first IE/PROFINET node under two devices, creates/reuses a subnet on the first, connects the second, and returns readback evidence. Requires: Connect + OpenProject + both devices added. Typical: firstRootPath='PLC_1', secondRootPath='HMI_KTP700_1/HMI_KTP700_1.IE_CP_1'. Verified for S7-1200 + KTP700 Basic PN. |
| GetDevices | [L1][Hardware] List all hardware devices (PLCs, HMI panels, drives) in the project with their attributes. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. Prefer GetProjectTree for a visual overview; use this when you need the exact device Name and attribute values for subsequent operations like AddDevice or SetDeviceItemAttribute. |
| AddDeviceWithFallback | [L1][Hardware] PREFERRED for natural-language device insertion. Adds a Siemens hardware device by probing the installed TIA catalog with fallback versions. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. Example: 'add CPU 1211C AC/DC/RLY' → family='S7-1200'. Families: S7-1200, S7-1500, WinCCUnifiedPC. For third-party/GSD devices use AddGsdDeviceWithProbe. |
| SearchHardwareCatalog | [L1][Hardware]Search the installed TIA Portal hardware catalog for Siemens or third-party catalog entries by keyword, MLFB/order number, device family, or description. Use this before adding hardware when the exact TypeIdentifier is unknown, especially HMI panels such as KTP700 Basic. |

### PLC-Online

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GetOnlineState | [L1][Category:PLC-Online][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Read the current online connection state of a PLC (Offline/Connecting/Online/Incompatible/NotReachable/Protected/Disconnecting). Does NOT change state — purely a read operation. Use before GoOnline to check current state, or after DownloadToPlc to verify the CPU is reachable. State=Online means the PC is communicating with the physical CPU. State=Incompatible means online but firmware/config mismatch — download required. State=NotReachable means network or IP configuration issue. NOTE: This reports Openness connection state, NOT the CPU operating mode (RUN/STOP). The TIA Portal public API does not expose CPU operating mode — check the CPU front panel LEDs or HMI for RUN/STOP status. |
| GoOnline | [L1][Category:PLC-Online][ONLINE-CONNECT][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Establish an online connection from TIA Portal to the physical PLC. Required before DownloadToPlc to confirm reachability, or for future online monitoring tools. Returns State=Online on success. If ipAddress is omitted, uses the IP address configured in the project's hardware configuration. If ipAddress is provided, overrides the configured IP for this session (useful for commissioning with a different IP). Common failures: NotReachable (wrong IP / no cable), Protected (CPU requires authentication — supply password), Incompatible (firmware mismatch). |
| GoOffline | [L1][Category:PLC-Online][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Disconnect the online session between TIA Portal and the physical PLC. Safe to call even if not currently online. Always go offline when monitoring or download is complete. |
| CheckDownloadReadiness | [L1][Category:PLC-Online][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject+CompileSoftware] Check whether a PLC is ready to receive a program download WITHOUT actually downloading. Verifies: DownloadProvider service is available, a network/IP configuration exists in the hardware config. Returns Ready=true only when all checks pass. Use this before DownloadToPlc to surface problems early (missing IP, no hardware config, etc.). Does NOT compile — run CompileSoftware first to ensure blocks are consistent. |
| DownloadToPlc | [L1][Category:PLC-Online][ONLINE-WRITE][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject+CompileSoftware+CheckDownloadReadiness] Download the compiled PLC program to the physical CPU over the network. The CPU will stop briefly during download and restart automatically (controlled by startAfterDownload). SAFETY: Verify no personnel are near the machine before downloading. This changes live PLC behavior. Workflow: Connect → OpenProject → CompileSoftware → CheckDownloadReadiness → DownloadToPlc → GetCpuOnlineState. On success State=Success or Warning. On Error check Errors[] for details. Default options (keepActualValues=true, consistentBlocksOnly=true) are safe for most scenarios. Set keepActualValues=false only when DB initial values must be reset — this is irreversible. |

### PLC-Software

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GetSoftwareInfo | [L1][PLC-Software] Get PLC software properties (language, version, block counts). Requires: Connect + OpenProject. softwarePath comes from GetProjectTree (e.g. 'PLC_1'). Use GetSoftwareTree for the full block hierarchy. |
| PlcBuildAndImport | [L1][PLC-Software] MAIN tool for creating new PLC blocks from natural language. Build one PLC artifact (UDT/tag table/GlobalDB/FC/FB) from structured JSON, then optionally import and compile. Use dryRun=true first to validate. Workflow: describe block in JSON → dryRun → review → dryRun=false to import. Replaces the multi-step Build*Xml + ImportBlock sequence. |
| ImportPlcTagTable | [L1][PLC-Software]Import one PLC tag table XML file into PLC software (best-effort) |
| WritePlcSclSourceFile | [L1][PLC-Software][Offline] Write SCL source text to a local .scl external-source file (UTF-8 WITH BOM, so Chinese comments are not imported as mojibake/乱码). This tool does NOT connect to TIA Portal and does NOT import anything — it only writes the file to disk and returns the path plus manual-import instructions. Use it as the robust fallback when XML block import is rejected (e.g. a TIA V20 portal rejecting V21 SimaticML tokens: 'Cannot create SW.Blocks.CompileUnit... token not supported'): the user imports the .scl manually in TIA via project tree → 'External source files' → 'Add new external file', then right-clicks the source → 'Generate blocks from source'. The sclContent must be a complete source, e.g. FUNCTION_BLOCK \ ... END_FUNCTION_BLOCK. |
| CompileSoftware | [L1][PLC-Software] Compile all blocks in the PLC software. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. Returns basic success/failure. For structured error/warning details use CompileAndDiagnosePlc instead. Must compile before ExportBlock if any blocks are inconsistent. After adding new blocks via import, always compile to catch type/interface mismatches. |
| GetSoftwareTree | [L1][PLC-Software] Get the full PLC block/type/external-source hierarchy as ASCII tree. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. softwarePath from GetProjectTree (e.g. 'PLC_1'). ALWAYS call before ExportBlock/ImportBlock to get exact group paths (e.g. 'Program blocks/FBs/FB_Motor'). Returns OB/FB/FC/GlobalDB/UDT/ExternalSource blocks with group hierarchy. |
| ImportBlock | [L1][PLC-Software] Import a single SimaticML XML block file into PLC software. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. importPath must be an absolute path to a .xml file. After import it reads back to confirm the block is present (Meta.verified); call CompileAndDiagnosePlc for full consistency. Pick the right tool: SCL/.s7dcl text → ImportFromDocuments; multiple XML files → ImportBlocksFromDirectory; a full exported program (UDTs+tags+blocks) → ImportPlcProgramFromDirectory; JSON-built blocks → PlcBuildAndImport. |
| CompileAndDiagnosePlc | [L1][PLC-Software] PREFERRED compile tool. Compiles PLC and returns structured errors/warnings by recursively walking CompilerResult.Messages (V20/V21 PublicAPI). Leaf diagnostics include Path + Description; optional Line/Column via GetAttribute when exposed. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. |
| ImportType | [L1][PLC-Software]Import a type from file into the plc software |

### Portal

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| Connect | [L1][Portal] Connect to a running TIA Portal instance or start a new one. MUST be the first tool called in every session. On success, state becomes Connected=true. If TIA Portal is not installed or the user is not in the 'Siemens TIA Openness' Windows group, this will fail — run EnsureOpennessUserGroup first. |
| ListPortalProcessProjects | [L1][Portal]List running TIA Portal processes and the projects/sessions visible in each process. |
| EnsureOpennessUserGroup | [L1][Portal]Ensure current Windows user is in TIA Openness user group (may prompt UI). Returns success=true when membership is OK. |
| Disconnect | [L1][Portal] Disconnect from TIA Portal and release the Openness handle. Call after all project work is done. Any unsaved changes will be lost — call SaveProject first if needed. |

### Project

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GetProject | [L1][Project] List all open local projects and multi-user sessions with their attributes. Requires: Connect. Use this to confirm which project is active, or to find the project name for AttachToOpenProject. |
| OpenProject | [L1][Project] Open a local TIA Portal project (.apXX) or multi-user session (.alsXX) file, where XX is the TIA version number (e.g. .ap21, .als21). Requires: Connect. Closes any currently open project first. After success, call GetProjectTree to explore its structure. |
| AttachToOpenProject | [L1][Project]Attach MCP to an already-open TIA Portal project by name (avoids disposed project handles). |
| CreateProject | [L1][Project] Create a new empty TIA Portal project. Requires: Connect. After creation, call AddDevice to add PLCs/HMIs, then GetProjectTree to verify. The project is automatically opened after creation — no separate OpenProject call needed. |
| ScaffoldProject | [L1][Project] One-shot project generator: from a single JSON spec it creates the project, adds PLC (and optional Unified HMI) hardware, builds UDTs/global DBs/PLC tag tables, imports SCL external sources and LAD S7DCL documents, compiles, sets up the HMI connection/screens/tags, and saves — collapsing the ~20-step runbook into one call. Auto-connects if needed. Critical-step failures (connect/createProject/PLC device) abort; per-element failures are collected and reported. Spec keys: projectName(required); directoryPath?(default %TEMP%); plcName?(PLC_1); plcFamily?(S7-1500); plcMlfb?; hmiName?(omit to skip all HMI); hmiFamily?(WinCCUnifiedPC); hmiSoftwarePath?(HMI_RT_1); connectionName?(HMI_Connection_1); udt?/globalDb?/tagTable? = arrays of the same json objects PlcBuildAndImport accepts; sclSourceFiles? = array of .scl file paths; ladDocs? = array of {importPath,name}; hmiScreens? = array of {screenName,width,height,designJson(object)}; hmiTags? = array of {tagTableName?,tagName,hmiDataType?,plcTag?,address?}; compile?(true); save?(true). Returns a per-step report with compile error/warning counts. Pass dryRun=true to validate the spec offline (PLC block JSON shapes, SCL/LAD file paths, designJson) WITHOUT connecting to TIA or creating anything. |
| SaveProject | [L1][Project] Save the currently open project or session to disk. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. Call after any significant change (device add, block import, HMI edit). Compile first if there are pending changes to ensure consistency. |
| CloseProject | [L1][Project] Close the currently open project or multi-user session. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. Any unsaved changes are lost — call SaveProject first. After closing, the connection remains active but no project is open. |
| GetProjectTree | [L1][Project] Get the full project device/software tree as ASCII art. Requires: Connect + OpenProject. ALWAYS call this first after opening a project to discover the exact softwarePath (e.g. 'PLC_1') and device paths needed by all other PLC/HMI/hardware tools. Returns device names, software nodes, and HMI nodes. |

| EnsureSubnet | [L2][Hardware] Ensure an Industrial Ethernet/PROFINET subnet by anchoring on a real deviceItemPath from GetProjectTree/GetDeviceItemTree. Applies only through TIA Openness, then returns readback evidence (node path, subnet name, interface path). Does not guess paths. |
| AttachDeviceNodeToSubnet | [L2][Hardware] Attach one real device network node to an existing PROFINET subnet and return readback evidence. deviceItemPath must come from GetProjectTree/GetDeviceItemTree, interfaceIndex selects a discovered Industrial Ethernet/PROFINET node, and online/force operations are never used. |
| SetCpuCommonSettings | [L2][Hardware] Set CPU common settings using exactAttributes JSON only after reading exact attribute names from GetDeviceItemInfo/GetDeviceItemNetworkInfo. The tool writes only those exact attributes, rejects missing/non-writable attributes, and returns readback evidence. |

### Online-Monitoring

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| ProbePlcMonitorOnlineCapabilities | [L2][Online-Monitoring]Read-only probe for PLC online/offline/watch/monitor API surfaces. It does not go online/offline, change watch tables, write values, or touch restricted safety APIs. |
| ReadPlcWatchTableCurrentValuesReadOnly | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Read current/monitor value properties from an existing PLC watch table only. It does not create/modify watch tables, write PLC values, go offline, or use force operations. |
| PlanOnlineReadOnlyMonitoring | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Validate an online-monitoring request shape without connecting to TIA Portal. Read-only preflight only: no go-online/offline, no watch-table modification, no value write, and no force operation. |
| PlanOnlineReadOnlyDataProvider | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Plan the commercial current-value path through an external read-only data provider such as opcua or s7-readonly. This is a preflight only: it does not connect, write PLC values, modify watch tables, go online/offline through TIA, or use force operations. |
| ProbeS7CpuIdentity | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Read-only: connect to a physical CPU over the S7 protocol (ISO-on-TCP, port 102) and read its identification (module type, serial, names). Does NOT write, force, or change CPU mode. Use this first to confirm the IP belongs to the intended PLC before reading values. S7-1200/1500 use rack 0, slot 1. |
| ReadPlcLiveValuesS7 | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Read-only FAST live values from a physical CPU over the S7 protocol (port 102), independent of TIA Openness. Give absolute S7 addresses (DB10.DBD0:REAL, DB1.DBX2.3, M0.0, MW12, DB5.DBD8:DINT). Returns current values in one round-trip (typically tens of ms). NEVER writes/forces. Preconditions for S7-1200/1500: enable 'Permit PUT/GET access' on the CPU and read NON-optimized DBs (M/I/Q are unrestricted). Use expectModuleContains to hard-guard the target identity. |
| TraceTagCause | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Answer 'why is tag X this value / what sets it' by static analysis of the OFFLINE project. Read-only: exports code blocks to SimaticML and finds every network that WRITES the tag (LAD coils S/R/=, or StructuredText ':=' assignments) plus the gating condition operands in those networks. Cross-reference service is not needed. Then live-read the returned gatingConditions with ReadPlcLiveValuesS7 to see which condition is currently driving the value. Tip: pass blockScope to limit which blocks are scanned (faster). |
| ReadPlcLiveValuesOpcUa | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Read-only live values from a CPU's OPC UA server (default opc.tcp port 4840), independent of TIA Openness. Anonymous, no-security session; reads the Value attribute of each node. NEVER writes or calls methods. Node IDs use OPC UA syntax, e.g. 'ns=3;s=\.\' or 'i=2258'. Precondition: the CPU's OPC UA server must be enabled and the variables exposed (Runtime license on S7-1200/1500). If the server is off, connection is refused (reported cleanly). |
| MonitorWatchTableLiveS7 | [L2][Online-Monitoring] Read-only: live-monitor an existing TIA watch table. Reads the table's entry addresses (Openness, read-only) and live-reads them over the S7 protocol (port 102). Returns name/address/value rows. Never edits the watch table, writes, or forces. Absolute-address entries (e.g. %DB1.DBW0, %MW4) are read; symbolic/optimized entries are listed as unresolved (use OPC UA for those). Identity guard via expectModuleContains. Use GetPlcWatchTables to list table names. |

### PLC-Alarms

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| ExportAlarmClasses | [L2][Category:PLC-Alarms][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Export PLC alarm classes to a file.

Use before bulk alarm class updates to create a backup. |
| ImportAlarmClasses | [L2][Category:PLC-Alarms][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Import PLC alarm classes from a previously exported file. Overwrites existing alarm class definitions. Run CompileSoftware after import. |
| ExportAlarmTextLists | [L2][Category:PLC-Alarms][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Export all PLC alarm text lists to an XLSX (Excel) file. Text lists contain the text strings shown for each alarm condition. Supports multi-language projects — all configured languages are exported. Typical use: export → translate in Excel → ImportAlarmTextLists. |
| ImportAlarmTextLists | [L2][Category:PLC-Alarms][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Import PLC alarm text lists from an XLSX file. The file must match the format exported by ExportAlarmTextLists. Run CompileSoftware after import to validate alarm configuration. |
| ExportAlarmInstanceTexts | [L2][Category:PLC-Alarms][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Export PLC alarm instance texts to an XLSX file. Instance texts are the alarm messages tied to specific FB/FC instances (e.g. Motor_01.AlarmText). Options control what additional columns are included in the export. Typical use: export → fill in alarm descriptions → ImportInstanceTexts (not yet exposed — edit via TIA Portal UI). |

### PLC-Builders

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| BuildPlcUdtXml | [L2][PLC-Builders][Offline] Build a TIA V21 PLC UDT/PlcStruct XML document from structured JSON. Input: {members:[{name,datatype,externalWritable?,commentZhCn?}]}. It only returns XML; it does not connect to TIA Portal, import types, write files, or modify projects. |

It only returns XML; it does not connect to TIA Portal, import blocks, write files, or modify projects. |
| BuildFlgNetCallXml | [L2][PLC-Builders][Offline] NARROW SCOPE: builds ONLY a LAD network that calls one FC with parameters. For general ladder (contacts/coils/SR/compare/Move/math) author S7DCL text and import with ImportBlocksFromDocuments — there is no XML builder for those, and hand-written FlgNet XML is the usual cause of import errors. Build a TIA V21 LAD FlgNet/v5 FC call network XML from structured JSON. Input: {callName,parameters:[{name,section,dataType,sourceKind?,symbolPath?\|symbol?\|value?}]}. It only returns XML; it does not connect to TIA Portal, import blocks, write files, or modify projects. |

It only returns XML; it does not connect to TIA Portal, import blocks, write files, create instance DBs, or modify projects. |
| ComposePlcLadFcBlockXml | [L2][PLC-Builders][Offline] NARROW SCOPE: every network must be an FC call; this cannot emit contacts/coils/SR/compare/Move/math. For general ladder, author S7DCL text (.s7dcl + .s7res) and import with ImportBlocksFromDocuments instead. Compose a TIA V21 LAD FC block XML containing one or more FlgNet/v5 FC-call networks. Each network is an FC call described as { callJson: { callName, parameters[] }, titleZhCn?, commentZhCn? }. Top-level: blockName, blockNumber, optional inputs/outputs members, optional commentZhCn / titleZhCn. Returns XML only; does not connect to TIA Portal or import. Pair with ImportBlock. |

### PLC-Online

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GetPlcForceTables | [L2][Category:PLC-Online][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] List all force table names in the PLC software. Force tables configure which variables are continuously forced to specific values while the CPU is online. Use SetForceTableEntry to configure entries, then go online for the forces to take effect. |
| SetWatchTableModifyValue | [L2][Category:PLC-Online][ONLINE-WRITE][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject+GoOnline] Configure a watch table entry to write a value to a PLC variable once (or on a trigger). This is an OFFLINE CONFIGURATION step — the value is written to the PLC only when TIA Portal is online and the trigger fires. Trigger options: Permanent (every cycle), PermanentAtStart (every cycle, at scan start), OnceOnlyAtStart (single write at scan start), PermanentAtEnd, OnceOnlyAtEnd, OnceOnlyAtStop. Use GoOnline before calling this for the write to reach the PLC. Does NOT use Force — variable reverts to PLC logic after the modify. To hold a value persistently, use SetForceTableEntry instead. Example: SetWatchTableModifyValue('PLC_1', 'Debug_WT', 'DB1.DBX0.0', 'TRUE', 'OnceOnlyAtStart') |
| CompareSoftwareToOnline | [L2][Category:PLC-Online][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject+GoOnline] Compare the offline PLC software in the project against the program currently running on the physical CPU. Use after editing blocks to confirm what differs from the live CPU before downloading, or after a download to verify offline/online consistency. Returns a tree-walked list of differences (only entries where ComparisonResult is not 'Equal' are reported). Requires GoOnline to be called first; will return IsOnline=false with guidance otherwise. |

### PLC-OpcUA

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| GetOpcUaConfig | [L2][Category:PLC-OpcUA][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Read the full OPC UA server configuration for a PLC: server interfaces, SIMATIC interfaces, and reference namespaces — each with their Name, Enabled state, and key properties.

| SetOpcUaInterfaceEnabled | [L2][Category:PLC-OpcUA][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Enable or disable an OPC UA server interface, SIMATIC interface, or reference namespace. Setting Enabled=true activates the interface — download to PLC is required for the change to take effect on the CPU. interfaceType options: 'ServerInterface' (default), 'SimaticInterface', 'ReferenceNamespace'. Workflow: GetOpcUaConfig → SetOpcUaInterfaceEnabled → DownloadToPlc. |
| ExportOpcUaInterface | [L2][Category:PLC-OpcUA][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Export an OPC UA server interface or reference namespace to an XML file. The exported XML can be inspected, modified, and re-imported. interfaceType: 'ServerInterface' (default), 'SimaticInterface', 'ReferenceNamespace'. |
| ImportOpcUaInterface | [L2][Category:PLC-OpcUA][PreCondition:Connect+OpenProject] Import an OPC UA server interface or reference namespace from an XML file. If an interface with the same name (derived from the file name) already exists, it is updated in place. Otherwise a new interface is created. Download to PLC after import to apply changes to the CPU. interfaceType: 'ServerInterface' (default), 'ReferenceNamespace'. |
